+
+The use of PDSE Member Generations can provide additional recovery
+capabilities as it allows access to previous versions, up to the generation
+limit defined for the PDSE. However, to access a generation requires the use
+of a generations-enabled application.
+
+Notes:
+  %*+Generations may not be accessed from JCL or Dynamic Allocation, or
+     from the majority of IBM and ISV ISPF applications.
+  %*+Member Removes (delete) and Renames should be done within a
+     generation-enabled application if the member has generations.
+     Otherwise orphan members will remain as only the base is deleted or
+     renamed, but they are hidden to all but generation-enabled tools.
+
