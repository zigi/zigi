                      %ZG - Stand-Alone ZIGI Interface
+
%ZG+is designed to be used from an ISPF Enhanced Member List (9 character
+line selection field) as a fast path interface to zigi.
+
+It may only be used of datasets that are part of a ZIGI managed repository.
+
+One 1st use in a dataset the user is prompted to select the ZIGI managed
+repository. At that point the selected dataset is verified that it is part
+of the repository and that information is then saved to bypass the prompt
+in the future. The member is then copied into the OMVS file system within
+the repository.
+
+Three options are provided at this point:
+  %A  +- Git Add the member to the repository
+  %AC +- Git Add and Commit the member
+  %ACP+- Git Add, Commit, and Push the member
