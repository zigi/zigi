+If there are binary members in the partitioned dataset along with text
+members, use the %A+option to add the entire PDS to Git. Then, from the
+Current Repository menu, select the PDS and in the PDS Member display use
+the%AB+line selection to add the member in binary format.
+
+The members selected as binary are copied in binary format to the
+OMVS filesystem, they are entered into the .gitattributes file with a
+binary designation, and they are tagged in OMVS as binary files.
