@Henri Kuiper+of zDevOps (www.zdevops.com, www.zigi.rocks and
+github.com/wizardofzos)
+
+Henri is the instigator and initial developer of zigi. Without his epiphany
+there wouldn't be a zigi as you see it. He provided the insights, logic, and
+code for 99% of the Git processing.
+
@Lionel B. Dyck+21st Century Software (www.21stcenturysoftware.com)
+
+Lionel nudged Henri to get the project rolling beyond Henri's initial efforts
+and is the impetus for the ISPF elements and other features. Lionel is
+a prolific tool creator who has been blessed with management allowing him to
+share his creations, which can be found at www.lbdsoftware.com.
