                             zigi Release Notes
                                Version 2.7

                         New Features and Functions
                         --------------------------

Support file extensions for PDS members when copied to OMVS. The extension
is defined when the PDS is added to zigi for management and only one extension
is allowed per PDS, and it may NOT be changed. The extension is then removed
when the file is copied to the PDS.

Redo the Current Repository Action Bar Menu. Split out General and Repository
into General, Maintenance, and Repository.

New Check command to be used by the user to check the state of the z/OS
datasets on demand. The check will occur when the repository is opened and
then only when the user requests. The state of the OMVS files will continue
to be checked frequently as the user interacts wtih the repository.

Reduce processing overhead by only checking z/OS datasets for changes if
they have changed since the last date that zigi checked them. The test
will be to check the dataset if the last reference date (from listdsi)
is the same as the current day or if it is greater than the last
reference date as saved by zigi in the users home directory under
.zigi/filename where filename is the OMVS file copy of the z/OS dataset.

Enable multiple row selection in many instances (not all).

Improved detection of deleted, or renamed, PDS members during PULL
processing.

Improved detection of deleted, or renamed, PDS members at zigi repository
startup.

Bug Fixes and Other Updates:

  1. Check z/OS dataset exists before attempting to copy to OMVS
  2. Table panel updates to use zgsr instead of zscr for scrolling field
  3. Small cosmetic updates to some panels
  4. Change ZIGICKOT
       - check for .zigi/dsn before reading it - in case non-zigi repos
       - if not there then set recfm/lrecl/blksize defaults
       - continue to do selective dataset/member restores but do a full
         ISPF stats reapply
  5. Remove check for hyphen for 1st char of dsname
  6. Remove tbquery that is not required

                                Version 2.6

                         New Features and Functions
                         --------------------------


Add the Info command to the Current Repositories set of commands to display
a summary about the repository.

Add Change History as an option on the Help action bar to view the change
history, which is a copy of the Release Notes dataset.

On the Current Repository table allow multiple rows to be selected (S) for
serial processing.

On the TagList Extract save the tag information in an OMVS file for
historical purposes.

Improved progress status messages on dataset/file rename.

Support the use of a hypen (-) in a z/OS dataset name.

On the Current Repository SET command panel add the option to change the
dataset prefix. The new prefix must have the same number of qualifiers and
will result in all the z/OS datasets being renamed along with any OMVS files
based on the prefix qualifier ignore value.

                             zigi Release Notes
                                Version 2.5

                         New Features and Functions
                         --------------------------

  /--------------------- From zigi 2.0 ------------------------\
  | The former use of -M with CP to convert the @#$ special    |
  | characters to/from z/OS for unix has been replaced by      |
  | escaping those characters where required to preserve them. |
  \------------------------------------------------------------/

Implement new feature 'zigiflow' to help the user make controlled
changes.  The Zigi Flow feature will assist with making updates to
repositories.  The general use case for using zigi flow is as follows:

    - Step 1: Start a new zigi flow
    - Step 2: Make all your changes, commit
    - Step 3: Finish your zigi flow

Implemented a basic conversion capability to convert a cloned non-zigi
configured git repository into a zigi repository. For this to work the
repository must have been cloned by zigi so that zigi 'knows' about it
and the following requirements of the repository must be met:

   - Each PDS is mapped to a subdirectory under the repository root
   - Each PDS member is a file in the appropriate sub-directory
       (e.g. main.asm in the asm directory)
   - Binary files must end in .bin
   - Only files, either sequential or PDS members, within the repository
      must conform to z/OS dataset naming conventions or they are
      treated as OMVS files.

After creating a new local repository open the Add Dataset instead of
requiring the user to do that (saves a step).

Provide the option to specify the codeset for character encoding during
Clone and Create repository processing. The default is IBM-1047 if not
specified.

Replace the intrusive menus on the table display panels with an Action
Bar set of menus. Also added on those panels an F3 under the scroll
amount to facilitate point-and-shoot. The O option is still available
to bring up a context sensitive command options menu and the / row
selection will bring up a context sensitive row selection options menu.

Implement new commands STASH to Stash Push to save the current workspace
and revert to the most recent Commit level.  And STASHL to list all
saved Stashes with these options:

    - Branch to create a new branch from a saved stash
    - Remove to drop a saved stash
    - Show to show the stash summary
    - Diff to show the summary and diffs
    - Pop to restore a saved stash

Provided an option to enhance point-and-shoot in the zigi Config panel.
Option S will leave things as they are. Option P will enable
point-and-shoot so that a double click outside the table will bring up
the Options command selection popup, and a double click inside the table
will bring up the row selection popup.

Change REFRESH command to REPLACE and add FETCH command for Current
Repository. Only Fetch when a repository is selected or on demand.

For Removes (deletes) add option to turn off prompting.

New zigi Cheat Sheet (pdf) and zigi User's Guide (pdf, azw3, mobi, epub)
have been created and are new with v2.5 which can be found at the zigi
wiki:

   https://github.com/wizardofzos/zigi/wiki/6.-Documentation

Update to the Current Repository commands menu to add ADDALL. This
command will do a git add for all Untracked or Modified datasets or
files.

Update to the PDS Member commands menu to add ADDALL. This command will
do a git add for all Untracked or Modified members.

Add a check to all ISPF panels asking for a userid to verify if the user
enters an 8 character userid that the system supports the 8 character
userid.

On the PDS Member table a new line option of AB to add the member in
binary format.

On the ADDDSN table an option for a PDS of AB to add the dataset as a
binary dataset. If a partitioned dataset will contain both text and
binary members then add the dataset as text (option S or A) and the from
the Current Repository menu select the dataset and then use the AB (add
binary) row selection for the binary members.

Fix for Bitbucket users where the clone clipboard copy contains 'git
clone' before the SSH info. The 'git clone' will now be automatically
removed to allow the Bitbucket user to just copy from Bitbucket and
paste into zigi for clone or remote add.

Add new TAG command on the Current Repository menu to add a git tag to
the current repository. Both the lightweight tags, without comments, and
annotated tags, with a short comment.

Add new TAGLIST command on the Current Repository menu to display a list
of all tags with an option to show the full tag details, or to create a
new branch from the tag level.

Add SORT option for the Local Repository display to sort the repository
list by Repository name, Prefix, or the Last used Date. One or two
columns may be sorted and the sort order is remembered when zigi ends
and is used at the next zigi start. The sort popup panel now supports
both the primary and secondary sort columns.

Added an optional tag field to the commit panel. Now a tag can be added
along with the commit.

Added a new Category field to the repository summary that is displayed
on the Local Repository table display. It is a sort column like the
other columns on the display.

New option to hide the splash screen if desired, and to restore it.

Additional validation on the Clone and Create panels to validate the
OMVS directory that is specified actually exists.

                                Version 2.0

                         New Features and Functions
                         --------------------------

  /------------------------------------------------------------\

  \------------------------------------------------------------/

Update to the GITLOG prompt to include, or exclude, diff's in the
report.

A new GITCMD dialog that enables the execution of any valid Git command
within the active Git repository. A command history is maintained so
that commands may be reused. The command results are then browsed or
viewed.  If the command table grows beyond the point the user is
comfortable with it then a CLEAR command is available to start over.

Grep processing has been enhanced with an option to view the results in
a report mode using the raw grep results or in a Dataset/File view where
the results are presented summarized by dataset or file. The display
allows selecting the individual dataset, or file, for Edit, Browse, or
View.

History is a dataset, PDS member, or file selection option that will
display a list of all commits for that element. From the table display
the user can select using C to view the commit entry, including the
diffs.  Selecting using S will view the historical version of the
element. While in ISPF View the user has access to all ISPF Edit
commands, including  Compare, Copy, and Create.

Merge supports merging another local branch into the current branch.
Merge conflicts can be resolved using ISPF Edit Compare or using a
customized Edit display that highlights the merge conflicts using the
Git provided conflict markers. At this time a merge performs a full
refresh of ALL datasets (this is planned to become a selective refresh
in a future release).

OMVS subdirectories with files are now supported. These directories and
files must be added outside of zigi at this time and when zigi starts it
will recognize those as untracked. The untracked directories, and/or
files, must then be added to the Git staging index for management by
Git.

Rename an element will rename the z/OS dataset, z/OS PDS member, OMVS
file, and any ISPF statistics file. It will also perform a git mv
(rename) so all Git information about the original will be retained with
the new name.

Remove an element will delete the z/OS dataset, z/OS PDS member, OMVS
file, and any ISPF statistics file. It will also perform a git rm
(remove) so all git information about the element will be deleted.

Added new row selection option of / to tables where it made sense. The /
will bring up a popup menu for the available section options. These
popups include an entry field and point-and-shoot capabilities.

Added new menu toggle to Basic and Pro that will remove ALL menus.

A new command option on those panels is O which will display a popup
command selection panel that support both an entry field and
point-and-shoot.

When the git log is viewed the git diff's will not be colorized with
blue for inserts and red for deletions. This only works when viewing and
not with browsing.

Update Pull processing to only refresh the z/OS datasets that are
updated during the pull process, and only the PDS members that were
updated. If more than 25% of the PDS members are updated then the full
PDS is refreshed.  Before ALL z/OS datasets were refreshed.

On the Local Repository panel the option to use 'S repo' to select a
repository from the command line. The 'repo' is case sensitive. This
allows for faster access to a repository.

Changed the debug logging when the ZIGIDEBG DD is present to log to a
file in the users home directory named zigidebug.d(julian
date).t(hhmmss). On exit from zigi a USS directory list (3.17) will be
presented to the user with just these files from which the user can
browse/edit/delete.

Update the Config panel to prompt the user for the default number of
generations to use when allocating every Partitioned Dataset during
Clone, Pull, or Refresh processing.

Update the Repository Delete dialog to enable the deletions of the
repositories z/OS datasets and add an additional entry field to confirm
the repository delete is really wanted.

Change the Current Repository ADD command to ADDDSN since that is what
it does to differentiate it from the Add selection option which performs
a git add.

Implement a new SNAPSHOT option for the Current Repository that creates
an Escrow version of the repository - the z/OS datasets and the OMVS
files. This is outside of zigi and git. It also generates a tag at the
time of the snapshot to enable easy access to the git repository for
reviewing information.

Implemented binary support. On the 'Add Dataset' panel zigi now supports
the 'AB' command. This will do the same as the trusted 'A' command (add
a dataset) to zigi, however this file will be treated as binary. This
allows you to have zigi manage your XMIT files, or OBJECT files. Load
modules obviously not supported. Take note, for a PDS this means ALL the
members in the PDS will be treated as binary. (this also updates and
commits the
.gitattributes file)

In the element History view a new option to Recover the historical
source is now available. It only works for z/OS datasets. Both PDS
members and PS datasets may be recovered. OMVS historical recovery is
not supported at this time. A PDS member must be recovered to a PDS
member, even if the recovery dataset is being allocated new.

Update Rollback with two new commands. ONLY (O) will limit the display
of commits to those with the provided string in the title (e.g. O roll)
in a case insensitive compare. REFRESH (R) will refresh the table back
to all entries.

New Undo (U) selection for datasets, OMVS files, and PDS members. This
will undo any changes made prior to a commit. After a commit the
Rollback option or the History Recover option will be required.

Speeded up the ADDDSN dialog initialization by replacing the use of
LISTC with IBM's sample IGGCSIRX code that was modified to return only
the dataset names.

Added to the ADDDSN dialog a Find/RFind capability to easily find the
dataset names to be added. Find works with a string that is searched
anywhere in the dataset name (e.g. F PDS will find the 1st occurrence of
a dataset with PDS in the name and repeat find (F5) find the next).
