%Branch+enables the user to create a new branch or to switch (checkout) an
+existing branch.
+
+If the user enters the name of a new branch then that branch is created from
+the current branch, pushed to remote (if present) and checked-out.
+
+The row selection options are:
+
+ %C+to checkout, or switch to the selected branch.
+    This will replace all existing repository, and z/OS datasets, with
+    the current state of the selected branch. The current branch is
+    untouched.
+
+ %D+to delete from the local system any branch that is no longer needed.
+    The remote branch is untouched.
