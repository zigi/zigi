+ Another format for the zigi managed repository is to have file extensions
+ for the PDS members that are copied to the OMVS filesystem. This feature
+ was implemented to enable the repository to be easily updated from both
+ ISPF on z/OS and from distributed git enabled clients.
+
+ When the z/OS dataset is added to zigi using the ADDDSN dialog, if the
+ dataset is a PDS then a prompt for a file extension will popup. The file
+ extension is optional and if it is blank when the Enter key is pressed then
+ the PDS members will be copied to the OMVS filesystem as before.
+
+ Only one file extension is allowed per PDS. This is to prevent a collision
+ where multiple files have the same name but different extensions.
+
+ Note that the file extension, once defined, may never be changed as it is
+ now an integral part of the zigi managed repository.
