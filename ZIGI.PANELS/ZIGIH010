                      %What is a zigi Managed Repository
+
+A Git repository that can be managed by zigi has the following characteristics:
+
   %1.+There must be a .zigi directory in the root directory of the
+      repository.
+  %2.+There must be a dsn file in the .zigi directory that has the basic
+      DCB information for the managed z/OS datasets.
+  %3.+A directory for each z/OS partitioned dataset in which each of the
+      PDS members have been stored, without any extension.
+      Members with a $,# or @ in them should be renamed according to 'cp -M'.
+      Both the directory name and the member file names must be in UPPER case.
+  %4.+The easy way to do this is to use zigi to create the repository, then
+      add the datasets to it. The created repository can then be connected to
+      a remote repository and pushed.
