                      %What is a ZIGI Managed Repository
+
+A Git repository that can be managed by ZIGI has the following characteristics:
+
   %*+There must be a .ZIGI directory in the root directory of the
+     repository.
+  %*+There must be a dsn file in the .ZIGI directory that has the file name
+     and DCB information for all managed z/OS datasets.
+  %*+A directory for each z/OS partitioned dataset in which each of the
+     PDS members have been stored, without any extension.
+     Members with a $,# or @ in them should be renamed according to 'cp -M'.
+     Both the directory name and the member file names must be in uppercase.
+  %*+The easy way to do this is to use ZIGI to create the repository, then
+     add the datasets to it. The created repository can then be connected to
+     a remote repository and pushed.
