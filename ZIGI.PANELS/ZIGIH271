+
%Merge+processing, when a conflict occurs, results in the current branch
+repository file having Git messages along with records from both the current
+branch and the merge branch. This makes it easy to identify the areas of
+conflict to resolve.
+
+For the ISPF user, the ISPF Edit Compare command is used to easily identify
+the new and old records along with conflicts. This allows the ISPF Edit user
+to resolve the conflicts and save the file so that the merge process can be
+completed.
+
+If the file is a PDS member then after the merge is resolved, the ISPF
+statistics file is recreated using the updated information.
