                             zigi Release Notes
                                Version 2.0

                         New Features and Functions
                         --------------------------

Update to the GITLOG prompt to include, or exclude, diff's in the report.

A new GITCMD dialog that enables the execution of any valid Git command
within the active Git repository. A command history is maintained so that
commands may be reused. The command results are then browsed or viewed.
If the command table grows beyond the point the user is comfortable with
it then a CLEAR command is available to start over.

Grep processing has been enhanced with an option to view the results in a
report mode using the raw grep results or in a Dataset/File view where the
results are presented summarized by dataset or file. The display allows
selecting the individual dataset, or file, for Edit, Browse, or View.

History is a dataset, PDS member, or file selection option that will display
a list of all commits for that element. From the table display the user
can select using C to view the commit entry, including the diffs.
Selecting using S will view the historical version of the element. While in
ISPF View the user has access to all ISPF Edit commands, including  Compare,
Copy, and Create.

Merge supports merging another local branch into the current branch. Merge
conflicts can be resolved using ISPF Edit Compare or using a customized Edit
display that highlights the merge conflicts using the Git provided conflict
markers.

OMVS subdirectories with files are now supported. These directories and
files must be added outside of zigi at this time and when zigi starts it
will recognize those as untracked. The untracked directories, and/or files,
must then be added to the Git staging index for management by Git.

Rename an element will rename the z/OS dataset, z/OS PDS member, OMVS file,
and any ISPF statistics file. It will also perform a git mv (rename) so
all Git information about the original will be retained with the new name.

Remove an element will delete the z/OS dataset, z/OS PDS member, OMVS file,
and any ISPF statistics file. It will also perform a git rm (remove) so
all git information about the element will be deleted.

Added new row selection option of / to tables where it made sense. The /
will bring up a popup menu for the available section options. These popups
include an entry field and point-and-shoot capabilities.

Added new menu toggle to Basic and Pro that will remove ALL menus.

A new command option on those panels is O which will display a popup command
selection panel that support both an entry field and point-and-shoot.

When the git log is viewed the git diff's will not be colorized with blue
for inserts and red for deletions. This only works when viewing and not with
browsing.

Update Pull processing to only refresh the z/OS datasets that are updated
during the pull process, and only the PDS members that were updated. If more
than 25% of the PDS members are updated then the full PDS is refreshed.
Before ALL z/OS datasets were refreshed.

On the Local Repository panel the option to use 'S repo' to select a
repository from the command line. The 'repo' is case sensitive. This
allows for faster access to a repository.

Changed the debug logging when the ZIGIDEBG DD is present to log to a file
in the users home directory named zigidebug.d(julian date).t(hhmmss). On
exit from zigi a USS directory list (3.17) will be presented to the user
with just these files from which the user can browse/edit/delete.

Update the Config panel to prompt the user for the default number of
generations to use when allocating every Partitioned Dataset during Clone,
Pull, or Refresh processing.

Update the Repository Delete dialog to enable the deletions of the
repositories z/OS datasets and add an additional entry field to confirm the
repository delete is really wanted.

The former use of -M with CP to convert the @#$ special characters to/from
z/OS for unix has been replaced by escaping those characters where required
to preserve them.

Change the Current Repository ADD command to ADDDSN since that is what it
does to differentiate it from the Add selection option which performs a git
add.

Implement a new SNAPSHOT option for the Current Repository that creates an
Escrow version of the repository - the z/OS datasets and the OMVS files. This
is outside of zigi and git. It also generates a tag at the time of the
snapshot to enable easy access to the git repository for reviewing
information.

Implemented binary support. On the 'Add Dataset' panel zigi now supports the
'AB' command. This will do the same as the trusted 'A' command (add a
dataset) to zigi, however this file will be treated as binary. This allows
you to have zigi manage your XMIT files, or OBJECT files. Load modules
obviously not supported. Take note, for a PDS this means ALL the members in
the PDS will be treated as binary. (this also updates and commits the
.gitattributes file)

In the element History view a new option to Recover the historical source is
now available. It only works for z/OS datasets. Both PDS members and PS
datasets may be recovered. OMVS historical recovery is not supported at this
time. A PDS member must be recovered to a PDS member, even if the recovery
dataset is being allocated new.

Update Rollback with two new commands. ONLY (O) will limit the display of
commits to those with the provided string in the title (e.g. O roll) in a
case insensitive compare. REFRESH (R) will refresh the table back to all
entries.
