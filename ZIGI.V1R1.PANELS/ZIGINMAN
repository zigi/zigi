+   to the following:
+   a. upload the repository files manually into z/OS datasets that are
+      appropriate to their type
+   b. in zigi use the CREATE command to create a repository
+   c. use the ADD command in the zigi Repository table panel to
+      add the z/OS datasets to the new repository
+                                 %or
%2.+z/OS datasets map to OMVS files for seqential and OMVS directories for
+   partitioned data sets with each PDS member as a file within the
+   directory. The file names are always upper case.
+                                 %and
%3.+A .zigi directory within the repository that contains at a minimum a
+   file called dsn. This file defines the characteristics of the each
