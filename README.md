## Installing zigi

Make sure you have git installed on your Mainframe.
In order to install git, head on over to https://www.rocketsoftware.com/ and create an account.
Then download git, bash, gzip and perl and bring all those files to one directory in USS.

Then head on over to https://gist.github.com/wizardofzos/897b243d4cbe9fbc471ec1396fbbe174 and stick that installer in the
same directory as the things you downloaded from rocket.

Run that script.

You should now have git installed on you Mainframe.

Clone this repository and run the installer via:

    git clone git@github.com:wizardofzos/zigi.git
    cd zigi
    ./zginstall.rex

### Make sure you are authorizes to allocate the target datasets

## Dovetail Support
Dovetail has released their Co:Z Toolkit which includes two new commands that ZIGI takes advantage of to greatly speed up copying PDS members from, and to, OMVS files. 

To use the Dovetail enhancements point your browser to https://dovetail.com and download the Co:Z Co-Processing Toolkit.  The use of this toolkit is subject to the Dovetail's Community Licensze which can be found at https://dovetail.com/docs/cozinstall/licenses.html 

When installing refer to https://dovetail.com/docs/cozinstall/install.html#inst_coz And note that the UID=0 (superuser) or other special permissions are not required for use with ZIGI. Also, you do not need to address other requirements or customizations such as z/OS OpenSSH.                 

## Contributing to zigi?

Yes please!


# Known Issues (maybe solutions...)

### Git not found (even though you installed it)
Zigi needs to find the git executable in the 'PATH'. To determine the 'PATH' zigi sources /etc/proifile and Ëœ.profile.
Make sure one of these files contains the correct EXPORT statements.

### Weird Certificate Errors
When faced with a "SSL Certificate problem: unable to get local issuer" this might 'fix' it. Please note that this will
disable encryption for all uses of git and this is strongly discouraged in non-sandbox environments.

    git config --global http.sslVerify false
